teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge other than theortical,content of courses are average,examination pattern is good,"not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies",library facilities are good but number of books are less,extracurricular activities are excellent and provides best platform to students.
Good ,Not good,Good,Good ,Not good ,Good 
Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual.,All courses material provide very good knowledge in depth .,"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it.",Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth. ,Library facilities are excellent in terms of good techniques that are used over there.,Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task.
Good,"Content of course is perfectly in line with the teaching philosophy that is being perpetuated here i.e cramming,rote learning.",Again the university tests students of their ability to memorize stuff. Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.,Good,"Its the best thing i have seen in this university,albeit the behaviour of library staff is unprofessional at times. They are whimsically rude.",Complete wastage of time. Again this opinion is strictly personal and may not coincide with others.
teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance.,content of courses improves my knowledge,examination pattern is good,practical work provides detail knowledge of theoretical work,library has huge collection of books from different authors,extracurricular activities increases mental and physical abilities
Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

It is good,This semester university has provide best teachers ,I like the question pattern,Everything is going fine in lab . learning new things. That is good for us,I am satisfied with the facilities but few books are limited of  database distribution ,No idea about the extracurricular activities.

It's good when compare with my Btech lectures and teaching activities.,Knowledge  and depth of the course  is good but while coming to the material it's not upto the mark.,"This university is far better than other university when coming to the exam pattern,marks disturbation and while coming to paper checking no biased corrections equal to all. ",Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech.,Good,While coming to extracurriculum activities it's better than any other university which I had come around.
Good,"Knowledge,depth of course is good but course material are not upto the mark",Great,Not upto the mark,Good,Awesome
way of teaching is good,course content is knowledgeable ,exam pattern is good and good paper checking.,lab improves practical knowledge,good library facilities,ok
"University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides,though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear..otherwise interaction with the faculty is good.Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is  fine. ",Content of the courses is good but some courses need improvement. Course material is not upto the mark. ,Pattern and procedure of the examination is very good. Paper checking needed to be improved.,Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is  at their respected desk.,Library facilities are very good. No issues ,This university is no1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels. 
Good,Good,Good,Good,Hardworking,Good

As compared to other colleges and university our university is perfect in all the aspects,Material of the course is not good enough ,Good,Practical work is fair,Excellent,Great job
Good,sometimes proper course material is not required.,Good,Good,Good,excellent
Lectures helps in clear our concept,Easily available course material with sufficient knowledge gaining,Good marks distribution Students can easily check there performance throught the semester,Practical and easy learning,Good,Its give various opportunities and exposure
"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student.","The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher.","Exam pattern and how it is conducted is really seems to be good but it's my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. So poor paper checking is there.","The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say.",Again some of the faculties don't know how to behave otherwise it is good.,This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there.
"University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input. ",The course notes are very knowledgeable and proper.,Descent.,Good.,Descent.,Good.

Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students .,Teachers are not giving depth of course . They trying to cover there work only .,It is statisfactory.,3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only ,"Well... all the books are not avilable . If they are in library , books are in less number and strength of student are large.",They are really very intersting. All the students enjoys alot and get a chance to showcase there talent
Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good

lecture delivery is not so good,every thing is fine,all good,practicle must be of 2 hours,the system in library usually does not work . so it creates a problem for us to issue the book,its good for refreshment 
It's good,It's appreciable,"Not that much good 
Students are working so hard
But they aren't getting satisfactory result","It's good 
Also depends on teacher's knowledge and student's interest","Sometimes only book is available for some subjects
And it is reserved","It's appreciable
Students who are having interest in co curricular activities, getting a good platform"
"Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but hv to do some work for quality of lecture",Satisfied,All are good except paper checking. It should be improved,All good,Its very helpful,All good
"Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems",The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by teachers. Hence the knowledge remains superficial,Overall all these things are the plus point of the university,Average ,"Awesome, peaceful, relaxing atmosphere",Good but lacks audience.....as only participants can see these activities on duty leave basis
Perfect,Awesome,Notbad,Too much lanlb file work,All books are not available,Perfect
It is really gud,It is proper,It is very gud,Evaluation method is gud.But the content is more to write in file,I think number of books are very less according to the students .Only 2-3 copies are available.,All the activities are gud and appropriate for students
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,Courses are very good and useful ,Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing,excellent,good,very good
in terms of lecture delivery that is good.in terms of punctuality that is also good but in terms of intraction that is very bad. There are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they do not coprate.,Its good,"Exam pattren is good, marks distribution is also good bt paper cheacking is very tight.",Its good,Thats good,"Thats good but the problm is whenever in university the functions like one india, one world are held we are not alowed to go because we have to attend the classes and if we miss the classes we will gona loose the attendence and everyone knows in lpu attendnce is very important. 
Thanx"
According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served. ,Everything is fine. Every thing is taught in depth.Even a single point is elaborated enough to understand. ,Everything is fine. ,I think electrotherapy practical should be of 2 hours.That's enough I think.Rest is fine.,I think stock is not enough more books are required. ,Chance to go and enjoy should be given.I think it should be off when any activity like One India is there to go and enjoy.Otherwise everything is good. 
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,Courses are very good and useful ,Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing,excellent,good,very good
not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty .,content is good enough,satisfactory ,lab duration of 3 hours is very long . ,very cooperative ,extracurricular activies should be held when there are no classes for the students to attend so that every student can enjoy and participate in the events

"The university is good but it also has a long way to go. More teachers should have their PhD and college fests related to academic curriculum must be improved to a great extent and must be managed properly.The interaction is good, lecture delivery needs more lucidity. The punctuality is top notch.",Content of the courses should be changed a bit. More of industry oriented feature like Linux and GitHub must be implemented. Proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the students.The course material is good.,The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet.,Lab evaluations are good.,Library facilities are the strength of this university. It is awesome.,Quite a lot of events are organized and students have a all round growth which is a nice thing.

The university consists of a whole world in itself.It is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly.I love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields.,The courses available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these courses goes on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activities and projects.,The examination system of the university is very impressive.The sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks.Through this students also get to know and visit different blocks of the university.The checking is also fair .,They are conducted in proper way.,perfect,unbiased
"teachers are pretty interactive,But it all depends on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher.Teachers are punctual and very helpful during exams time.",content of course is more than enough to get the basics of that particular subject.,Everything is pretty well organised,Teachers are supposed to let the students know the actual use of the instruments used in the lab.,They are good.,LPU gives the best opportunity for the students to show their talent.
teaching delivery is good .but it is better to reduce there speed of  lecture delivery to understand the student better,courses are also good .but lt of subjects in cse departments at 1st year it feels like burden upon us,good ,excellent ...they  work hard..their way of teaching is also pretty good,excellent,these are very usefull to students .excellent

interaction of some faculty was good but not all faculty..,depth  of course was good ....providing a basic knowledge not so deep in subjects....at least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subjects...,examination pattern was excellent,lab and practical works are good..with a little draw back of faculty in connecting  the lab practical to the outside  world..,library facilities are excellent...but only limited books are available ..so books should be increased.,extra curricular are so good. university is providing many pathways to many students....apart from education
"good, and also like the teaching style",I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is use full,good,I like it soo much,good ,good
"Interaction between students and teachers is good ,The lectures delivery is fine, punctuality is good
 

","depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS

All terms are good regarding the university activities,knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it.,That's good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions.,Labs helps to know how the work is done.It thought me a good lessons.,They are good.,Yes.
GOOD,HAVE TO IMPROVE,EXAMPATTERN IS GOOD AND MARKS DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO GOOD AND PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD ,IT IS GOOD,IT IS ALSO GOOD,VERY GOOD
intraction is good and leacture delivery also good and then punctuality is also is good,every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes,exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard,all labs and practical going on well,good ,they all are held in super
all the given terms are good regarding the university ,we are getting maximum knowledge ,all are good ,not bad,library facilities are not good.They are not following the rules( they are using phones in library).,good
All the terms are good regarding the university activities.,Knowledge is maximum gained  by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.,The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions.,Labs are upto the mark.,They are good,the extracurricular activities held in university  are very enjoyable and good
Some of the teacher are un experienced. Also they are unfair and baised. Infact many of the teachers are having few or no experience about the subject ,Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.,MCQ pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students.,Our labs do not have all facalities. ,We have a good library with all facalities.,Our university has lot of extracurricular going on and it helps us a lot.
IT IS GOING GOOD,HAVE TO IMPROVE,PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD REMAINING IS GOOD,ALL PRACTICAL WORK IS GOOD,"THEY IS NO PROBLEM WITH THEM
",IT IS THE BEST THING IN THIS UNIVERSITY I LIKE IT
